# Syncthing-iOS

This is a Syncthing-iOS Port with Golang Libary for iOS. I have compiled it with Golang 1.4.2 and did some changes for iOS in Go and Syncthing.

1. Please install at first Golang https://golang.org/
2. Instal Xcode with the latest Version
3. Get a clone from Golang Source https://github.com/golang/go
4. Edit the file /misc/iso/clangwrap.sh 

```
#!/bin/sh
# This uses the latest available iOS SDK, which is recommended.
# To select a specific SDK, run ‘xcodebuild -showsdks’
# to see the available SDKs and replace iphoneos with one of them.
SDK=iphoneos
SDK_PATH="xcrun —sdk $SDK —show-sdk-path"
export IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=7.0
# cmd/cgo doesn’t support llvm-gcc-4.2, so we have to use clang.
CLANG="xcrun —sdk $SDK —find clang"
exec “$CLANG” -arch armv7 -isysroot “$SDK_PATH” “$@”


To build a cross compiling toolchain for iOS on OS X, first modify clangwrap.sh in misc/ios to match your setup. And then run:
GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=arm CC_FOR_TARGET="pwd"/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh \
 CXX_FOR_TARGET="pwd"/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh ./make.bash
To build a program, use the normal go build command:
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=arm go build import/path

Let’s just try those instructions he gave, without modifying anything:

/* $ cd src
$ GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=arm \
    CC_FOR_TARGET=`pwd`/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh \
    CXX_FOR_TARGET=`pwd`/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh \
    ./make.bash 
###### Building C bootstrap tool.
cmd/dist
##### Building compilers and Go bootstrap tool for host, darwin/amd64.
lib9
libbio
liblink
cmd/gc
... */

#Now you can compile Golang for iOS successful
```

5. Please change in `/IDZWebBrowser/build-go.sh` to your Project paths. (`build-go.sh` do all the job for you with gcc)
6. Inside of Xcode go to the tab "Build Phases"
    There create a Run Script when not existing and a our `build-go.sh` script
      1. Input Files
        `$(SRCROOT)/main.go`
      2. Output Files
        `$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/glue-go.a`

This is a very very basic how to, and troubles? write me...
